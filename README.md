# Erno_Enigma
<p>This project was done in the second semester and the idea was to be able to solve the rubiks cube from ther state at which it is (which is scrambled) to the state whcih is solved fully. And the code is written entirely in C. After the the code was made, an attempot was made to use it in <b>Arduino based rubiks cube solver</b>.</p>
